<h1>Tiramisu recipe</h1>
    <h3>Ingredients:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>500 gr mascarpone</li>
            <li>6 eggs</li>
            <li>150 gr sugar</li>
            <li>1 package (400 gr) of ladyfinger biscuit (savoiardi)</li>
            <li>a couple of spoon of some liquor (rhum for example)</li>
            <li>2 mugs of strong coffee</li>
            <li>cocoa powder</li>
        </ul>

    <h3>Preparation:</h3>

        <ol>
            <li>Beat egg yolks and sugar in a bowl using a whisk or an electric mixer at medium speed for few minutes until the sugar melt and the cream became almost white.</li>
            <li>Add the mascarpone and the liquor and mix again.</li>
            <li>Prepare the coffee.</li>
            <li>Mix the egg whites with the whisk or the electric mixer until they hold still, then gently add the egg whites with the yolk-sugar-mascarpone cream, without mixing, but incorporating slowly to not unmount the white.</li>
            <li>Put part of the coffee in a plate and soak the biscuits in the coffee rotating them quickly, then dispose the biscuits in a large dish.</li>
            <li>When the first layer of biscuits is over, put half of the cream on top and gently spread it on all the surface.</li>
            <li>Spread some cocoa powder on top of the layer.</li>
            <li>Repeat the procedure with the rest of the biscuits to do a second layer, then add the rest of the cream and finish with cocoa powder.</li>
            <li>Let rest at least a night.</li>
        </ol>
    
<p>Enjoy!</p>
